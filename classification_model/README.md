This directory contains all the necessary code for future model integration.


if you want to run it, try with the following example:

`python main.py --loc -34.82929722222222,-58.40813611111111 --q 0.98`,

and check the `output.png` file to see the detection map.
If you try with `--loc 37.653770,-7.547798` you will find the original image as
output since it is a negatvie classification.
